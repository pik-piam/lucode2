\usage{
mergestatistics(
  dir = ".",
  file = NULL,
  renew = FALSE,
  quickcheck = FALSE,
  pattern = "*\\\\.[rR]da",
  removeCols = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Path to the run statistics repository}

\item{file}{path to an rds-file the data should be written to and from which
(if existing) already merged data can be read from}

\item{renew}{if set to TRUE the full data.table will be created again from scratch,
if set to FALSE merging will start with the existing file (if it exists) and just add
missing entries}

\item{quickcheck}{If active, the function compares last modification dates of repository data and
and merged statistics and cancels execution in case that there is no newer file in the data repository
(assuming that merge statistics are already complete). This is useful if this function is run
frequently and execution time plays a role, but might lead to cases in which the function is not run
even if the merge statistics are incomplete.}

\item{pattern}{detection pattern for rda files that should be merged}

\item{removeCols}{vector of columns that will be filtered out}
}
\value{
A data table containing the merged run statistics or NULL in case the data was not recalculated
}
\description{
Support function to merge run statistics which have been derived
with \code{\link{runstatistics}}
